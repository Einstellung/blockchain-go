This project is highly refrenced by [blockchain-go](https://github.com/Jeiwan/blockchain_go) but start different from part6.

I discard part6 and use libp2p to construct part7. But now consensus layer is leaky. I will learn more about consensus layer then rewrite this project again in next few months.

You can use `go run .` to start the project, then the terminal will tell you how to use this project.
